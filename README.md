# GLUU - GLSL to LUAU Converter ðŸš€

Pronounced just like "glue", GLUU is a robust tool designed to seamlessly convert GLSL shaders to LUAU. By bridging the gap between these languages, GLUU simplifies the integration process, making it easier than ever to bring your shaders to LUAU environments using dynamic images.

## ðŸŒŸ Features

- **Automatic Importing**: All necessary functions are automatically imported at the beginning of the converted code, ensuring smooth execution.
- **Comprehensive Testing**: GLUU has been rigorously tested using a variety of shaders from [Godot Shaders](https://godotshaders.com/shader-type/canvas_item) to guarantee accuracy and reliability.

## ðŸš§ Project Status

GLUU is currently under development. While the core functionalities are in place, we're continuously working to improve and expand the tool. Feedback and contributions are welcome!

## ðŸ”§ Getting Started

> Instructions on how to set up, use, and contribute to GLUU will be provided here once the project reaches a more stable phase.

## ðŸ“£ Acknowledgments

- Inspired by the vast collection of shaders available on [Godot Shaders](https://godotshaders.com/shader-type/canvas_item).
